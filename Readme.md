# K Means for GH and Dynamo

These are some simplified implementations of K Means for grasshopper and Dynamo. The files included here are 
- Implementation as an illustrative example in python
- Implementation in dynamo 
- Implementation in Grasshopper

For the sake of simplicity, a minimum number of external dependencies are used and almost all of the functionality (of the K means algorithm) is created using lists and native 'out of the box' functions in python.

## Installation/Prerequisites

For visualization purposes, The following external packages are used 
- Numpy (to generate a list only, not for processing)
- Matplotlib (For visualizing graphs)

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

Copy paste the code into GH or dynamo to run it 
_PLEASE NOTE: That the node's input values must match the inputs in the code block in either GH or Dynamo_
